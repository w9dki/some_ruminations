Using gcc-5 in Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) introduces a new twist for an Intel i7 2600k
Using a standard gcc-5 compile:
   gcc-5 -stc=gnu11 -Wall -Ofast -msse2...

This produces a strange result:

   gsl_zigg_dsfmt                      = 0.4544(s)
   Box-Muller                          = 1.8819(s)
   SIMD Box Muller with fast_sin-cos   = 1.4041(s)
   Box-Muller Manual SIMD              = 1.3998(s)
   SIMD Marsaglia polar                = 1.3129(s)
   Time for Leva Gaussian ratio        = 0.3940(s)

The executionspeeds for a 4096 x 4096 double complex array using Box-Muller and Marsaglia polar algorithms
are between 2-3 times slower in 16.04 than for Ubuntu 15.10 or 15.04!  However,  by trial and error, I found 
that including the gcc linker command - static in the string:

  gcc-5 -std=gcc11 -Wall -static -Ofast -msee2 ...  gives:
  
   gsl_zigg_dsfmt                      = 0.4124(s)
   Box-Muller                          = 1.1068(s)
   SIMD Box Muller with fast_sin-cos   = 0.5532(s)
   Box-Muller Manual SIMD              = 0.5778(s)
   SIMD Marsaglia polar                = 0.5440(s)
   Time for Leva Gaussian ratio        = 0.3837(s)

Note the factor of ~2 to 2.5 speed up for the Box-Muller and SIMD Marsaglia C codes. This is not a gcc-5 compiler
issue since earlier gcc compilers: gcc-4.8 ...,  and gcc-4.9 do not change the timings (in Ubuntu 16.04)
    
I think this has something to do with changes in the gcc linker and the Turbo mode of the i7 2600k processor in Xenial Xerus.  Interestingly using
Note that a laptop with a Core-Duo i5, T9900 mobile processor running at 3.06 GHz under 16.04 with or without the 
the -static linker option gives: 
   
   gsl_zigg_dsfmt                      = 0.6027s)
   Box-Muller                          = 2.2653(s)
   SIMD Box Muller with fast_sin-cos   = 1.0048(s)
   Box-Muller Manual SIMD              = 0.9970(s)
   SIMD Marsaglia polar                = 1.0796(s)
   Time for Leva Gaussian ratio        = 0.6908(s)
   
These laptop speeds for 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) are almost a factor of two faster than for the 4.6GHz, 
water cooled i7 2600k !!.... That is until the -static linker option is included.  Then the single thread, i7 
2600k code jumps to nearly twice as fast is the laptop...for only the Box-Muller and Marsaglia algorithms 
[~1.0048(s) vs 0.5532(s)]
   
I tried a fresh, clean install of Ubuntu 16.04 but saw no changes in behavior. I suspectthat Ubuntu 16.04 
does not activate the 2600k turbo mode the same as in 15.04 and 15.10 without using the 
-static option.  The -static linker option reates a complete, stand alone load module, which is analagous to a 
windows executable:  i.e. program_name.exe .
